Access to higher education is the ultimate dream in many young minds. The responsibility of the Universities
is to provide conducive environments to produce graduates who are not only equipped with up-to-date
knowledge,  skills and the right attitudes but also with the appropriate mindset  to progress in their chosen
careers. The University Grants Commission (UGC) is the apex body responsible for selection and allocation
of students to State  Universities  and Higher Educational Institutes (HEIs) established under the Universities
Act No. 16 of 1978 (as amended).
This publication provides the necessary guidance to help you to select the courses of study of your
preference. It also provides detailed information regarding policies, rules and regulations, minimum
qualifications required for University admission and other details. There is a separate section for
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
State University System offers 244 courses of study of  Universities (Uni Codes). Within the government
policy on Higher Education, all courses are offered free. In addition, students are supported with Mahapola
scholarships, government bursary and several other financial scholarships offered by non-state organizations
and philanthropists. Data indicates that 70% - 80% of students receive such financial assistance. Hostel
accommodation is provided at very subsidized rates and most peripherally located Universities offer
hostel accommodation throughout the period of stay in the university.
Due to the fact that All Island Merit is considered as the sole criteria for the selection to courses of study
in Arts degree programmes and,  60% of selection to all other degree programmes are on District Basis,
entry to State University System has become very competitive. For example, out of  92,379 students who
applied for University admission for the academic year 2019/2020, only 45,000 students were selected.
The University Grants Commission together with the State Universities is continuing to create more
opportunities to enhance the student access to higher education in Sri Lanka.
Life skills are an essential component for personality development for undergraduates and are sought and
highly rated by potential employers. There are ample opportunities within universities to enhance life skills
and other extra-curricular activities of undergraduates. University Grants Commission lays special emphasis
on enhancing English and IT as essential soft skills of all undergraduates. During the year 2020, new
English Language Teaching Departments (ELTD) have been established in the Universities. A uniform
examination with band levels called UTEL is now conducted for all University students. The UTEL certificate
will be very useful at the interviews for employment as objective evidence of competence in English.
Currently, University students have access to a wide array of sports activities including opportunities to
participate at  international sports events. The University experiences of students can be enriched by their
association with various student bodies in relation to subjects  (Ex. Physiology or Geography Club), arts,
culture (Ex. Arts Circle), religion (Ex. Buddhist Brotherhood, Muslim Majilis) and student unions etc.
We strongly encourage students to get involved in such activities. You can get the best out of all these
facilities to develop your soft skills.

ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
The UGC is the legally mandated authority for registration of students to State Universities & Higher
Educational Institutes established under the Universities Act  No. 16 of  1978. Therefore,  online submission
of  applications for University admission and online registration with the UGC for the selected course of
study of the University  is a mandatory requirement. The UGC certified  lists of  registered students are
then sent to Universities and Higher Educational Institutes. Universities enroll students only from the
certified lists sent by the UGC. The UGC will undertake the responsibility of the security of online systems.
All students who wish to apply for a placement to State Universities must read the book carefully
before completion of the online application. A clear understanding of different subject
combinations would help you to select the courses of study you are interested in entering into.
We have observed that failure to do so with care and precision  has resulted in, students losing
the most preferred academic programme or completely losing the opportunity to gain admission.
We wish you success in all your future endeavors !

SECTION 3
Instructions to use this Handbook
How to get the best out of this book?
This book is divided into 10 sections dealing with 10 different topics essential for students seeking
admission to State Universities and Higher Educational Institutes under the UGC after obtaining minimum
qualifications for university admission at the G. C. E. Advanced Level Examination held in 2020.
SECTION 1
Section 1 helps you  to understand the policies, rules and regulations that govern admission to State
Universities and other Higher Educational Institutes under the UGC. All Island Merit and District
Quota System, criterion for the selection of students under new and old syllabus, Z-Score, how the
‘Cut off’marks are determined in a given year and the criteria for determination of the district of a
particular candidate for the purpose of university admission are also explained in details under this
section. It also explains the reasons which makes you ineligible for admission to a State University or
a Higher Educational Institute under the UGC.
SECTION 2
This section is important to plan your future, especially if you are seeking admission to the
degree courses under the Humanities and Social Sciences stream. This is because the degree
programmes offered by the universities will expect different subject combinations for entry and you
must know this and understand before you apply for university admission. Also there are rules to select
the subject combinations from the different ‘baskets’ of subjects. This is little complex. Therefore, you
must read this section carefully and understand. It is best that you decide the subject combination you
should select, at the time of your entry to advanced level class.
Section 3 gives clear instructions for you to indicate preferences for the courses of study of universities
using Uni-Codes and the procedure for changing the order of preference of the Uni-Codes correctly.
Therefore, you are advised to read this chapter carefully and understand before indicating your order
of  preference of the Uni-Codes online.
SECTION 4
Section 4 discusses about the important topics such as the application procedure, procedure for
filling of vacancies, method adopted for remaining in the selected course of study of  the university
without getting elevated, procedure for obtaining a transfer, procedure to make an appeal etc.
This is also an important section, therefore, you are advised to read this section before start filling out
your application form for university admission online.

ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
SECTION 5
Section 5 explains the method to apply online for courses of study and universities of preference.
Clear instructions are given on how to complete an online application, facilities available for online
application even if you have no ability or facilities. UGC team will take the responsibility for the accuracy
and the safety of the online system for university applications.
SECTION 6
Section 6 explains about the admission of students under special provisions and entry criteria for
students who are admitted under special provisions.
SECTION 7
This section helps you to understand the facilities available in different  State Universities and Higher
Educational Institutes. It will also give a detailed account of the study courses available in all these
institutions.
SECTION 8
Section 8 is very important. This section provides you answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
by the students. For example, it will explain  how the district of a candidate for the purpose of university
admission is determined, whether you can sit for advanced level examination  again and apply for university
admission  after registering for a course of study and other FAQs. You must read this section. If you have
questions we have not answered, please feel free to write us direct or email and we will respond. We
will also add answers to such questions in future publications.
SECTION 9
Section 9 is the ‘cut-off ’ marks of the last admission to universities and this has been given to
you only as a guidance to give you an idea of the pattern of demand for different courses of
study. Please do not depend only on this in making decisions. Cut-off marks may vary between
years and this has been explained under Section 8; Frequently Asked Questions.
SECTION 10
Section 10 contains specimen application forms for appeals, admission of candidates who have
excelled in extracurricular activities and for admission of blind/differently abled candidates.
Any clarification relating to interpretation of the rules and statements made in this handbook
is the responsibility of the UGC and the decision of the UGC relating to such interpretation
thereon shall be final.

ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
SECTION 1
Policies and Principles governing admission to first degree programmes in State
Universities and Higher Educational Institutes under the University Grants Commission
1.1 Admissions Policy for State Universities and Higher Educational Institutes
Admissions policy differs between the subject streams.
For students seeking admission to Arts courses mentioned in 1 to 10 of the Section 2.1 (1) of this
handbook, All Island Merit is the main criterion used for selection. The district basis is not used for
selection of students in this category. Therefore, all students compete on an equal basis for placements
for those courses of study.
The total number to be selected for a course of study is based on a national policy. The decision is that
the total number of students admitted from a given district for a particular course of study will not be
below the total number admitted to that course of study from that district in the academic years
1993/1994 or 2002/2003, whichever is greater.
However there is one exception to All Island Merit selection criterion for selection of students to Arts
courses.
The exception is, for selection of students to the following categories of Arts courses.
1.
Music
2.
Dance
3.
Drama & Theatre
4.
Visual Arts
5.
Visual & Technological Arts
6.
Art & Design
Selection for these courses is based on the district quota system which is explained below.
Also selection to all other streams, namely Commerce, Biological Science, Physical Science, Engineering
Technology, Biosystems Technology and courses of study listed in Section 2.2.8 of this handbook for
which students from different subject streams are eligible is based on the following criteria.
1.
Up to 40% of the available places of a particular course of study is selected on the order of Z-scores
ranked on All Island Merit.
2.
Of the remaining 60%, up to 55% is selected on the district quota system. The district quota system
is that, for a given district, in addition to the number selected under the All Island Merit (40%),
additional seats are made available up to the remaining 55%.  Accordingly, up to 55% of the available
places in each course of study will be allocated to the 25 administrative districts in proportion to the
total population of each district; that is on the ratio of the population of the district concerned to the
total population of the country.
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
- 9 -
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
3.
In addition, there are 16 districts, recognized and classified as educationally disadvantaged districts.
The remaining 5% of the total available seats are given to the students of these districts. This again
is allocated on the ratio of the population of each such district to the total population of the 16 districts
recognized as disadvantaged districts. The 5% is for all 16 districts and not for one district.
 The 16 districts categorized as ‘educationally disadvantaged’ are,
1. Nuwara Eliya
7.
Vavuniya
13.
Polonnaruwa
2. Hambantota
8.
Trincomalee
14.
Badulla
3. Jaffna
9.
Batticaloa
15.
Monaragala
4. Kilinochchi
10. Ampara
16.
Ratnapura
5. Mannar
11. Puttalam
6. Mullaitivu
12. Anuradhapura
The criteria for selecting students of old syllabus and new syllabus for the academic year
2020/2021, based on the aforesaid admissions policy
The percentages of selecting students for each course of study from the new syllabus and the old
syllabus for the academic year 2020/2021 will be calculated based on the following criteria.

The University Grants Commission decided to consider the students who sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced
Level) Examination, 2020 under new syllabus and old syllabus as two distinct populations as directed
by the Supreme Court in SC(FR) Application No. 29/2012.

Accordingly, the selection of students to universities will be determined on the basis of rank order
on average Z -Scores obtained by the candidates from the old and new syllabi at the G.C.E.(Advanced
Level) Examination, 2020 released by the Commissioner General of Examinations, subject to  following
conditions.
a. The percentage of students to be admitted  to universities from those sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced
Level) Examination under the new syllabus in the year 2020 for each degree programme (course
of study) on district  merit from each district and all island merit shall be the composite average
percentage of students admitted to universities through their first and second attempts during the
five year period from 2014 to 2018 for that particular degree  programme (course of study) on
district merit from each district and all island merit, respectively.
b. The  percentage of students to be admitted to universities from  those sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced
Level) Examination under the old syllabus  in the year 2020 for each degree programme (course
of study) on district merit from each district  and all  island merit shall be the composite average
percentage of  students admitted to universities through their third attempt during the five year
period from 2014 to 2018 for that particular degree programme (course of study) on district merit
from each district and all island merit, respectively.
However, due to non availability of complete 5 years data of the courses of study introduced after
academic year 2014/2015 in order to select students based on the criteria mentioned under ‘a’ and ‘b’
above, selection of students for those courses of study will be done based only on the available data of
the said courses of study.
However,  in selecting students for a given course of study, it will be ensured that the quota
allocated to any district (i.e. the total of 55% and 5%) will not be below the quota in the
academic year 1993/1994 or 2002/2003, whichever is greater.
It should be noted that the actual numbers selected could vary from the proposed figures by
universities for each academic year, because of the practical problems encountered in allocating
students to universities and other unavoidable factors. The approximate distribution of the
numbers among different universities is given in Annex (b) of this Handbook.
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
- 10 -
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
A limited number of students will also be admitted on special grounds as specified in Section 6 of this
Handbook, subject to the conditions set out therein.
1.2
Minimum requirements for university admission
Candidates who are pronounced eligible for university admission by the Commissioner General of
Examinations  should have obtained;
(a)
At least ‘S’ grades in all three approved subjects in one sitting, within a maximum of three
attempts.
(b)
A minimum mark of  30% for the Common General Paper
1.3
Z score obtained by the students at the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examination
Z score is calculated and given to UGC by the Department of Examinations of the Ministry of Education.
This is a statistical calculation. The calculation is based on three factors.
i.
‘Raw marks’ of students for the given subject for the given year
ii.
Mean of the performance of that subject for the given year
iii.
Standard deviation of that subject for the given year
Therefore, the Z score changes with the educational achievements of the students and the total number of
students offered a particular subject in the given year.
1.4
‘Cut off’ marks required for admission to different courses of study at different
Universities
Cut off marks are calculated by the University Grants Commission. ‘Cut off ’ marks for a given course
of study will depend on the factors such as how well the candidates have performed at the G.C.E.
(Advanced Level) Examination in a  given year, the demand for a particular course of study and the university
and the number of seats available for the course of study.
Accordingly, ‘Cut off’ marks may vary from year to year depending on factors such as performance of
students who have applied for that particular course of study for that year, total number of places offered
by universities for that particular course of study, the population of each district etc.
Sometimes, some students may not apply for university admission expecting to sit for the advanced
level examination again. Also some students may apply for university admission but will not get registered
for the course of study for which they have been selected because of change of mind.

Candidates who have not obtained 30% or above for the common general paper are
not eligible for registration for the courses of study of the universities for which
they have been selected based on the Z Score in the current academic year.

If such a candidate has obtained a minimum of 30% for the common general paper
in a previous attempt within three attempts allowed for university admission, the
previous achievement can be considered.

Candidates who have not obtained a minimum of 30% shall re-sit and obtain a
minimum of 30% for the common general paper in a next available year within three
attempts allowed for university admission, to be eligible to get registered for the
courses of study of the universities for which the candidates have already been
selected based on Z Score, in a future academic year.
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
- 11 -
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
Therefore, when applying for university admission, students are strongly advised to apply for
a maximum number of eligible courses of study with their preferences irrespective of their Z
score and the previous years’ cut off marks.
1.5
Criteria for determination of the district of a candidate for university admission
In order to decide the district of a candidate for university admission, the candidate must provide evidence
of enrolment in schools for the period of last three years in his/her application form for university
admission. For this purpose, the Head of the school in which the candidate is currently studying should
certify the accuracy of the information provided by the school candidate in his/her application form on
the basis of school records and for private candidates, a Justice of Peace / Commissioner for Oaths
should certify  the accuracy of the information provided by the candidate in his / her application form on
the basis of the School Leaving Certificate.
The three year period is calculated backwards from the last date of the month, which is the month,
immediately preceding the month in which the candidate sat the advanced level examination to qualify for
university admission. For example, if the advanced level examination is held in October, the three year is
calculated backwards from 30th September of that year.
Accordingly, the district of the school of which the candidate has studied at least one year or more
during the three year period considered, will be considered as the district of the candidate for university
admission.
If the candidate has enrolled in more than one school during the said three-year period, then, the district of
the school of which the candidate has studied most number of days is considered as the district of that
candidate for the purpose of university admission. However, that duration compulsorily should be at
least one year or more. For example, a candidate has studied in a school located in a district for one year
and three months and the remaining one year and nine months in a school located in another district, then
the district of the school in which the candidate has studied for one year and nine months will be the district
for the purpose of university admission.
However, let us assume, if a candidate has studied  in a school located in one district for eleven months
and in two schools located in another district for nine months and ten months respectively. Then the
second district will be considered as the district of the candidate for the purpose of university admission
as the total period studied in that district (one year and seven months) is greater than the period studied
in the first district (eleven months) and also the total period studied in the second district is greater than
one year.
If the schooling period of the candidate is less than one year from any of the districts or candidate has not
enrolled in any school for advanced level during the three year period considered, the district where the
permanent place of residence of the candidate is located is the district considered for university admission.
For the purpose of confirming the permanent place of residence of the candidate, following two
documents should be submitted along with the application.
These two documents are,
i.
Original of the School Leaving Certificate or Original of the Pupil’s Record Sheet.
ii.
Original of the Grama Niladhari Certificate (DS4 Certificate)
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
- 12 -
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
Note :
For private candidates, it is compulsory to submit the original School Leaving Certificate along with
his / her application for university admission.
1.6
Admission criteria for State Universities and Higher Educational Institutes established
under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 (as amended)
1.
All students are provided an equal opportunity to enter state higher education.
2.
To be fair to all, opportunity to enter into a free state sponsored course of study is given only once.
3.
This is because, withdrawal from the registration of the course of study the student got selected or
non-reporting after getting registered to a degree program  will cause loss of opportunity for university
admission of another student in the same year. Also, by requesting to withdraw the registration and get
registered to another course of study based on the results of a subsequent year, the student is trying to
deprive the opportunity of another student who sat the examination in that subsequent year.
4.
The opportunity will be given for university admission, based on the results of one of the three attempts
allowed to sit for the G.C.E. (Advanced  Level ) examination for the purpose of university admission.
Accordingly, when applying for registration, the student is allowed to apply on the results of the same
examination based on which the applications for university admission are called.
5.
Once the candidate, upon receiving the letter of selection from the UGC, having made
the payment of Rs. 50/= as the registration fee in credit of the UGC, to the bank or online
and registers online via the official website of the UGC for the selected course of study of
the University/ Higher Educational Institute to which he/she has been assigned, on or
before the last date given for registration, he/she is deemed as a registered student at a
University/Higher Educational Institute, established under the Universities Act No 16 of
1978 (as amended) as mentioned in Section 1.6 (8) below.
6.
After making the payment, the date on which the online registration to the selected course
of study of the university has been completed via the official website of the University
Grants Commission will be considered as the date of  registration.
Accordingly, after making the due payment in credit of the UGC to the bank or online, on
or before the last date given by the UGC for registration to the selected course of study of
the university, if the candidate fails to complete the registration online as stated in
Section 1.6 (5) above, that will not be accepted as a valid registration.
7.
Also, if the payment is made to the bank, candidate should upload and send a scanned
copy of the Paying in Voucher to UGC when getting registered online, in order to
verify the payment.

Note:
 (i)
If  the information provided by the candidate along with the application for university

1.8
Steps taken to reduce the delay in admission of students to the universities
1.
Unless there are reasons beyond our control (E.g. Court cases), in future, UGC will call for
applications for university admission as soon as possible.
2.
Therefore, it has been made compulsory to apply for university admission online. This will
help to reduce the time lost for processing paper applications, which enables UGC to release cut
off marks early.
3.
Clear guidance for online submission of applications is given in the Section 5 of this handbook.
4.
If you do not have facilities to apply for university admission online or not confident to use the on-
line system, the regional centers of the Open University of Sri Lanka (NAC Centers), Provincial
and Zonal ICT Centers under Ministry of Education and Nenasala Centers under the Information
and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) closer to your residence mentioned at the end
of Section 5 of this handbook will help you for the online application process free of charge.
5.
Once cut off marks are released, all selected students must use the online registration system to
register for the selected course of study of the University or the Higher Educational Institute.
Please note that this is also a mandatory requirement. Safety and security of the online
application and online registration systems are guaranteed.
6.
Getting the students registered online for the selected course of study of the university as
mentioned in Section 1.6 (5) above is one of the steps introduced to reduce delays in the process
of university admission.
7.
Registration of students to courses of study of the Universities or Higher Educational Institutes
online through the UGC website will reduce the registration delays that may occur at individual
university level due to multitude of reasons which may be beyond their control.

Introduction to Uni-Codes system and instructions to use Uni-Codes for indicating the
order of preference
This section mainly includes clear instructions for you to mark your preferences for the Uni-Codes
and the procedure for changing the order of preference of the Uni- Codes correctly. Therefore,
you are advised to read this chapter carefully and understand before filling your preferences for the
Uni-Codes online.
3.1 Introduction to Uni-Codes system and instructions to use Uni-Codes for indicating the
order of preference
1.
In the academic year 2020/2021, there are 119 different degree programmes conducted by
15 National Universities, 03 Campuses and 04 Higher Education Institutes under UGC.
2.
A unique code (a unique identity) is given to each individual course of study in a particular
university /campus / institute.
3.
This unique code is referred as “Uni-Code”.
4.
In total, there are 244 Uni-Codes.
5.
The list of Uni-Codes is given in page no. 139 - 144.
6.
Students could apply for any number of Uni-Codes (i.e. any number of courses of study of
universities) to which they are eligible to apply.
7.
They should arrange their “Uni-Codes” from the highest preferred Uni-Code to the
lowest preferred Uni-Code.
8.
Sequence should indicate the decreasing  interest to a Uni-Code, in the mind of the student.
9.
Students are strongly advised to mark the maximum number of Uni-Codes which
they are eligible to apply when filling the application.
10.
Students should not depend on the cut-off marks pattern of the previous year given in the
Handbook, as that information is given only to make candidates understand the demand for
a given Uni-Code.
11.
Marking the maximum number of Uni-Codes is important because a student will not be
allocated to a Uni-Code (course of study of a university) if the student has not requested that
Uni-Code, even if the cut off mark for that Uni-Code will make the student eligible for that
course of study of the university.
For example, if a student is eligible to enter into a particular Faculty of Medicine based on the
Z-score obtained, yet not indicated the preference to the relevant Uni-Code which identifies
that Faculty and requested Dental Sciences instead as the next preference, then the student
will be selected for Dental Sciences without getting selected to that Faculty of  Medicine,
even though he/she is eligible to enter into that particular Faculty of  Medicine.
12.
Please note that a student will not be considered for a Uni-Code if the student has
not requested.
SECTION 3
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
- 111 -
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
13.
Students are not allowed to enter the same Uni-Code more than one occasion in
the order of preference.
14.
UGC will always attempt to select the candidate to his/her most preferred Uni-
Code. However, if the seats of that Uni-Code are already filled with the candidates
who have obtained higher z-scores than him/her, then the next preferred Uni-Code
for which the candidate is eligible will be considered.
15.
The students are not eligible to apply for all 244 Uni-Codes. A choice for a candidate will
depend on the subjects offered at the G.C.E.(Advanced Level) Examination.
E.g: Students who offer Biological Science are not eligible to apply for Engineering, so the
choice for a particular student would be much lower than the 244 options. However,
each candidate can mark up to a maximum of 125 choices in the application.
Students are strongly advised to mark the maximum number of Uni-Codes which
they are eligible to apply, when forwarding the application
3.2
Basis of assignment of students to courses of study of the universities (Uni-Codes)
Selection of eligible candidates to follow a particular course of study at a university will be
based on the following criteria for the academic year 2020/2021. (In addition, candidates
should have fulfilled the other pre - requisites of the course of study).

Z score obtained by the candidate

Preference given to courses of study of universities by the candidates (Order of
“Uni-Codes”)
When a candidate has indicated preferences for more than one course of study of a university,
at first, he/she will be considered for admission to the course of study and the university to
which he/she has given first preference. If the candidate is not selected for that course of
study and the university he/she will then be considered for the next course of study and
the university he/she has given second preference in the application. This process is illustrated
by the following example:
Assume that a candidate has indicated ten courses of study with universities in the following
order of preference, in his/her application;
Eg.
        “Uni-Code”
1.
Management - University of Sri Jayewardenepura
2.
Management (Public) Honours - University of Sri Jayewardenepura
3.
Management - University of Colombo
4.
Commerce - University of Sri Jayewardenepura
5.
Estate Management & Valuation - University of Sri Jayewardenepura
6.
Management - University of  Kelaniya
7.
Business Information Systems (Honours) - Sri Jayewardenepura
8.
Law - University of Colombo
9.

ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
This candidate will be considered first for the course of study in Management at University
of Sri Jayewardenepura, then for the course of study in Management (Public) Honours at
University of Sri Jayewardenepura, next for the course of study in Management  at University
of Colombo  and so on according to his/her order of preference until he/she is selected or
found not qualified for any of these ten courses of study. Let us presume that his/her Z
score, which is inadequate for both courses of study in Management and Management
(Public) Honours at University of Sri Jayewardenepura and qualifies him/her for admission
to the course of study in Management at University of Colombo, he/she will then be selected
for the course of study in Management at University of Colombo and will not then be
considered for any of the preferences given in 4 to 10 above.
If a particular candidate has not given preference to a course of study of a university (Uni-
code) for which he/she could have been selected according to the Z score, he/she would not
be allocated to that course of study and the university for which he/she has not indicated a
preference. Instead he/she would be considered to the next choice of course of study and
the university preferred by him/her.
In the selection the course of study and the university both will be considered together.
Candidates are considered only for the courses of study of the universities for which
they have marked a preference.
Candidates will not be considered for the courses of study of the universities to which
they have not marked a preference.
Important:
If a student is not getting registered to a selected course of study of a university (Uni-
Code), he/she will not then be considered for any other university to follow the same
course of study, under filling of vacancies even if the student has given higher preferences
for the same course of study in different universities in the application form for university
admission. Instead, his/her application will be considered for the next course of study
higher preferred.
You will be able to understand this further from the following example.
Example 1:
Assume a student has indicated preferences for courses of study of universities in his/her
application form for university admission as given in the next page.
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION

10.
Applied Sciences (Bio) - Rajarata University of Sri Lanka
Assume that this student got selected to Biological Science at University of Ruhuna
which is his/her 8th preference in the application form for university admission under the
normal intake. However, if the student did not get registered for Biological Science at
University of Ruhuna, he/she will not be considered for University of Kelaniya, University
of Sri Jayewardenepura and University of Colombo which are his/her 7th, 6th and 5th
preferences respectively, to follow the course of study in Biological Science under the
filling of vacancies. Instead, he/she will be considered for preferences given in 4 to 1
above.
Example 2:
Assume that the student mentioned in the above example got registered for Biological
Science at University of Ruhuna to which he/she got selected under the normal intake
and which is his/her 8th preference in the application form. However,  if the student gets
selected for Biological Science at University of  Kelaniya which is his/her 7th preference
in the application form, under the filling of vacancies and not getting registered for the
same, then he/she will no longer be considered for University of Sri Jayewardenepura or
University of Colombo which are his/her 6th and 5th preferences respectively to follow the
course of study in Biological Science under the filling of vacancies, even if the student has
already got registered at University of Ruhuna to follow the course of study in Biological
Science. Instead, he/she will be considered for preferences given in 4 to 1 above.
Therefore, if a student decides not to get registered for a selected course of study of a
university (Uni-Code), it means that the student wishes not to get considered for any
other university to follow the same course of study, to which the student has indicated
higher preferences in the application form.
However,   if the student wishes his/her application to be considered  for a higher preferred
university than the currently selected university to follow the same course of study under
filling of vacancies, first he/she should get registered at the UGC for the course of study
of the university already selected. Accordingly, if the student given in the Example 1
wishes his application to be considered for the course of study in Biological Science at
University of Colombo under the filling of vacancies, he/she should first get registered

Procedure for filling of vacancies /method adopted for not getting selected to some
of the higher preferred courses of study of universities under filling of vacancies
or to remain in the currently selected course of study and the university without
getting elevated to any of the higher preferences under filling of vacancies
   4.2.1
Criteria for filling of vacancies
Vacancies may arise in a particular course of study of a university as a result of non-
registration of students selected under the normal intake. These vacancies are filled subject
to the provisions made in Section 3.2 of this Handbook, on the following basis;
(i)
Vacancies arisen in a particular course of study of a particular university (Uni-Code) due to
non-registration of students selected under the merit quota will be filled by the students next
in line on an all island merit basis.
(ii)
Vacancies arisen in a particular course of study of a particular university (Uni-Code) due to
non-registration of students selected under the district quota will be filled by the students
next in line on a district merit basis. Vacancies in a particular district will be filled with
students from the same district.
(iii)
When an additional number of students have been selected over and above the district and
merit quota due to clustering of students at the same mark point or any other practical
reason, such additional number will be deducted from the number of vacancies and only the
balance will be filled.
(iv)
Also in the filling of vacancies, both the course of study and the university to which candidate
has given preference will be considered together.
If a particular candidate has not given a preference to a course of study of a university
(Uni-code) for which he/she could have been selected based on Z-score he/she would not
be selected to that course of study of a university for which he/she has not indicated a
preference. Instead, he/she would be considered to the next choice of course of study of
the university (Uni-Code) preferred by him/her.

university admission or wishes to remain in the course of study of the university (Uni-
Code) currently selected without getting promoted to any of the higher preferred courses
of study of the universities under future rounds of filling of vacancies, should follow the
following steps when getting registered online for the course of study of the university
(Uni-Code) currently selected.
1.
Click on the Promotion Declaration button.
2.
Then, the list of higher preferred Uni-Codes than the currently selected course of
study of the university, arranged according to your order of preference will be
displayed.
3.
Carefully select  the Uni-Codes for which you do not want to be considered
under  future  rounds of  filling of  vacancies  for which  you  have  given  higher
preferences than the already selected Uni-Code (put a “” mark in relevant check
boxes). However,  if  you do not want to be considered for any of the courses of
study of  universities  (Uni-Codes)  in  future for  which  you  have  given  higher
preferences and wish to remain in the already selected course of study of university,
you may click on the check box in the last column of the header row to select all
the  Uni-Codes in one go. The Uni-Codes selected  by you for  removal  will  be
crossed off.

unwanted Uni-Codes for filling of vacancies will also be displayed in the Online
Payment Receipt generated at the end of the online registration process).
5.
If you want to re-change the Uni-Codes list which you have selected for removal,
you can re-follow the steps (1) to (4) above.
6.
If you fail to remove the courses of study of  universities (Uni-Codes) for
which you do not want to be considered in future rounds of filling of
vacancies, you should accept and get registered for the course of study of
a university to which you would be elevated according to the higher
preferences indicated in the application form for admission.
(ii)
Vacancies are filled in several steps according to the above criteria until the proposed
intake of a particular course of study of a university is met.
(iii)
 According to the example given in the next page, presume that a candidate is selected to
the course of study in Biological Science at University of Colombo (8th preference) based
on the cut off marks for university admission.
In the filling of  vacancies, candidate may be selected to the course of study in Radiography
at University of Peradeniya (6th preference) or Physiotherapy in University of Colombo
(5th preference).

If the candidate wishes to remain in the selected course of study in Biological
Science at University of Colombo without getting elevated to a course of study of
higher preference, it should be mentioned clearly as explained in Section 4.2.2 (i)
above, when getting registered online to the selected course of study of the
university. Otherwise the candidate should accept the course of study of the
university to which he/she would be elevated according to his/her higher
preference.
However, if the candidate does not get registered for the selected course of study
in Biological Science at  University of Colombo which is his/her 8th preference in
the application form, he/she will not then be considered for Biological Science at
University of Peradeniya which is his/her 4th preference, under filling of vacancies,
as explained in the paragraph named “Important” in Section 3.2.
4.3
Procedure to obtain a transfer from one university to another for the same course
          of study
When vacancies are filled candidates may be selected to a course of study of a university or
a higher educational institute (Uni-Code) for which they have given a higher preference.
Therefore, candidates do not need to send a separate request to be selected to the same
course of study conducted by a different university of higher preference given in the appli-
cation.
Also, please note that mutual transfers are not allowed under any circumstances.
Courses of study and universities for which the candidates have indicated higher preferences
are offered based on the vacancies available for those courses of study and universities on
the basis of  Z-score as per the criteria in the Section 4.2 above.

UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
In admitting students to universities, it is a common practice in many countries to reserve a few
places for special categories of students such as those who have excelled in sports, arts and culture,
blind and differently abled, personnel of armed forces, teachers and foreign students.
Only a very few number  is admitted on the special grounds specified above.
The special categories of candidates who qualify for special admission to universities in Sri Lanka
are described below.
6.1  Blind and Differently Abled Candidates
The UGC may, at the request of the universities concerned, decide to admit a limited number of
blind students [who sat the G.C.E (Advanced Level) Examination, 2020  using the Braille system] to
the course of study in Arts and differently abled students (who are medically certified as disabled)
to courses of study in Arts, Commerce, Biological Science and Physical Science.
It is important to note that, only candidates who satisfy the minimum requirements for university
admission (set out in Section 1.2 of this Handbook) and the appropriate subject pre-requisites (set
out in Section 2.2 of this Handbook) for the relevant course of study will be considered under this
special provision.
Applicants are required to submit medical certificates acceptable to the UGC in proof of their
physical disability in any occasion as requested by UGC. For the purpose of this section, physical
disability shall mean a permanent physical impairment which has affected normal life.
Applications for admission under the category of blind and differently abled candidates
specified above should be made in the prescribed form appearing at the Annex-III of
this Handbook.
The duly perfected application forms of the differently abled candidates attached with
the certified copies of medical reports should be sent along with the applications for
university admission to reach the Senior Assistant Secretary / University Admissions,
University Grants Commission,  No. 20, Ward Place, Colombo 07 on or before the closing

6.2  Students who have Excelled in Extra Curricular Activities
Up to 0.5% of the places from the proposed intake in each course of study other than courses
offered by the University of the Visual and Performing Arts have been reserved for candidates who
have obtained 1st,  2nd or 3rd places at national level and / or achievements at international levels in
such fields as sports, cultural activities (e.g. dancing, painting, music and literature), scouting and
cadetting, social work and other extra curricular activities between 01.10.2017 to 30.09.2020 but
have failed to gain admission under the normal intake because of the shortfall of a few Z - scores.
In the case of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts up to 4% of the places from the
proposed intake in each course of study have been reserved for the admission of students under this
category.

knowledge and skills in five broad thematic areas, namely (i) crop and animal production, (ii) agro-product
processing technologies, (iii) sustainable management of natural resources, (iv) socio-economic development
and business management and (v) professional development required to become well rounded graduates. As we
believe that being trilingual will open up world of employment opportunities for the graduates, we have also taken
initiatives to provide Tamil Language learning opportunities for Sinhalese students and Sinhala Language learning
opportunities for Tamil Students in partnership with National Institute of Language Education and Training.
The curriculum of the degree offers a judicious balance of practical (laboratory and field) and theoretical
components to enable the undergraduate to discover both the world of science and technology and the world of
management. The curriculum of the degree comprises of two main components namely (a) core programme and (b)
advanced programme. In the “core programme” students are exposed to subjects offered by all the eight academic
departments giving a firm footing as a multi-skilled and a versatile individual. During the “advanced programme”
the students can choose a discipline of his/her own liking from among 12 specialization modules offered by the 8
departments. The final semester (4200), is totally devoted to a research project in which students undertake a
comprehensive study related to agriculture or allied field. This, of course, is a rare opportunity to rediscover
oneself with various other subject areas which one had to opt out when choosing the biology subject stream for
his/her GCE (A/L) Examination. This diversity of higher educational opportunities made available through the
degree programme have enabled the faculty to turn out top-caliber professionals in a wide array of fields as
attested by the key positions held by the alumni, both locally and internationally. Thus, the future of graduates
with B.Sc. Agricultural Technology and Management degree is bright and promising. Based on the programme

SECTION 8
1.
How do I apply for university entrance?
Candidates should apply online for university admission via the official website of the UGC
(www.ugc.ac.lk) and forward the duly signed printed copy of online generated application form to
the UGC via registered post along with the other relevant documents on or before the deadline
given for application as pronounced by the press notices.
Important:
It is compulsory to apply for university admission online
           2.
What is a Uni-Code?
Uni-Code is a unique code (a unique identity) given to each individual course of study of a particular
university/campus/institute.
All the Uni-Codes are given in pages 137 to 142.
Candidates should use these Uni-Codes to indicate their order of preferences when filling out their
applications for University Admission online.
The instructions to indicate the preferences correctly using Uni-Codes are given in Section 3 of this
Handbook. Therefore, you are advised to read this section carefully before indicating/changing the
order of preferences of Uni-Codes online.
   3.
Why it is important to have a list of Uni-Codes arranged according to your order of
preferences before start filling the application online?
Candidates are considered only for the Uni-Codes for which they have marked a preference. They
will not be considered for Uni-Codes to which they have not marked a preference.
Accordingly, if a particular candidate has not given preference to a Uni-Code for which he/she
could have been selected according to the Z-score, he/she would not be allocated to that Uni-Code
and instead he/she will be considered for the next choice of Uni-Codes. Therefore, you must have
a list of  Uni-Codes carefully prepared before start  filling the application form for university admission
online.
Also, you are advised to mark preferences for a maximum number of Uni-Codes in order to avoid
the risk of not getting selected to a Uni-Code for which you are eligible due to the fact that you have
failed to indicate a preference as mentioned above.
           4.
Is it possible to change the order of preference indicated by the applicant after submitting
the application to the UGC?
Yes, the order of preference including adding and removing uni-codes could be changed within one
month of the closing date of applications as per the instructions given in the Admissions Handbook.
Candidates need to change the order of preference online according to the instructions given in the
Admissions Handbook and send the duly signed printed copy by registered post to the UGC.
Frequently Asked Questions by the students  (FAQs)
- 241 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
The signature you place on the printed copy of the new order of “Uni-Codes” should be same as the
signature you have already placed in your first application for university admission.
By changing your order of “Uni-Codes” at this stage, the entire order of preferences given by you in
the first application will be cancelled and you will be considered for the selection of students for
university admission based on the new order of preference given by you.
5.
How to change the order of preference for courses of study of universities online?

Login to your profile via UGC website (www.ugc.ac.lk) using  your User  ID & password.

Change the order of preference.

Send the printed copy with your signature to UGC by registered post.
6.
How can I check whether my application has been received by UGC?
Once your application is received by UGC, you will be notified by a text message to the mobile
phone number given by you in your application.
7.
Is it possible to predict the course of study and the university to which a candidate will be
assigned before releasing the cut off marks?
No.
The cut off marks for courses of study/universities will be based on Z score, order of preference of
candidates, number of places available in universities etc.
8.
Is it compulsory to send the original school-leaving certificate along with the application
form by private candidates?
Yes.
If a candidate fails to provide the original School Leaving Certificate, his/her application will be
rejected.
9.
How could a student get information regarding the minimum Z score for each course of
study of universities from different districts?
1.
Newspapers
2.
UGC website www.ugc.ac.lk
3.
UGC Public Relations Office
4.
SMS service provided by the Government Information Centre (1919)
10. How can I get to know whether I am selected for university entrance?
You will be informed by a letter from the UGC.
11. Are mutual transfers allowed?
No
12. Could I apply to a course of study if my Z score is below the district ‘cut off’ for that
course of study of the university published for the previous academic year as given in the
Admissions Handbook?
Yes. You can apply and you should apply to as many eligible courses, regardless of the cut-off
points of the previous year. Cut - off marks for selected courses of study of universities for a district
may vary from year to year, depending on performance of the students (Z - score) for that year and
the number of seats available in the universities.
Some students with adequate Z - scores may decide not to apply and decide to do the advanced
level again and others may apply but will not register. Therefore, opportunities may arise. So, if you
decide to apply you must apply to as many as possible eligible courses of study.
- 242 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
13. Can I sit for Advanced Level Examination again and apply for university admission
after registering for a course of study of a university?
No.  All students are provided an equal opportunity to enter state higher education and to be fair to
all, opportunity to enter into a free state sponsored course of study is given only once.
This is because, withdrawal from the registration of the course of study the student got selected will
cause loss of opportunity for university admission of another student in the same year. Also, by
requesting to withdraw the registration and get registered to another course of study based on the
results of a subsequent year, the student is trying to deprive the opportunity of another student who
sat the examination in that year.
14. When can a student considered as a registered student of a University/Higher Educational
Institute?
Once the candidate, upon receiving the letter of selection from the UGC, having made the payment
of  Rs. 50/= as the registration fee in credit of the UGC, to the bank or online and registers online via the
official website of the UGC for the selected course of study of the University / Higher Educational
Institute to which he/she has been assigned, on or before the last date given for registration, he/she is
deemed as a registered student at a University/Higher Educational Institute, established under the
Universities Act No 16 of 1978 (as amended) as mentioned in Section 1.6 (8) of this handbook.
15. What is the basis of deciding the district of a candidate?
The basis is to select the district of the school you were enrolled for at least one year or more during
a period of three years when you were studying advanced level subjects.
16. How is the three-year period calculated?
Three year period is calculated backwards from the last date of the month, which is the month,
immediately proceeding the month in which the Advanced Level Examination is held. For example,
if the Advanced Level Examination is held in October, the three year is calculated backwards from
30th September of that year.
17. What if I have been enrolled in more than one school during this period?
The district of the school the student has studied most number of days (However, this period
should be at least one year or more) is considered as the district for university admission.
18. What if I have not enrolled in any school or if my schooling period for G.C.E.(Advanced
Level) Examination is less than one year?
District where your permanent residence is located will be considered as the district for university
admission. To prove this, you must provide documentary evidence as given in Section 1.5 of this
Handbook.
19. Why information and the dates of practical / aptitude tests are not published in the
Handbook?
The universities arrange practical /aptitude tests and the dates may change each year depending on
many factors. Each university publishes press notices calling application for aptitude tests.
Section 5 of this Handbook clearly mentions courses of study which conduct practical /aptitude
tests & the contact details of such universities are also mentioned in Annex (d). Since universities
conduct the practical /aptitude tests, students can contact the university for more information  regarding
practical /aptitude tests.
- 243 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
20. What if I pass the practical / aptitude test but not within the cut off for the same course of
study?
To enter the course of study that requires a practical /aptitude test, you must obtain required
Z score in addition to passing the practical / aptitude test. You will not be selected to a course of
study merely by passing the practical / aptitude test, if you have not obtained sufficient Z score.
21. Would I be allowed to defer my admission, once I am registered?
Students are allowed to defer only after registration for the selected course and the university. You
need to have a very genuine reason for deferment. Once registered, if they defer, they cannot enter
into any other degree programme based on subsequent, better advanced level result. Registration to
the state university or Higher Educational Institute can be done only once.
Maximum period for deferment is one year.
22. Why cannot the UGC allow students to register & de-register?
This is because admission criteria of free education system is complex and must be fair to all
students.
Admissions policy is 40% from All Island Merit, 55% on District Quota, depending on the population
of the district & 5% from educationally disadvantaged districts. Everyone has to have an equal
opportunity to free education.
Therefore, one person cannot be given more than one chance where a complex 40%, 55%, 5%
formula is used to select the best students for 104 degree programmes; approximately the best
45,000 candidates out of nearly 92,379 applicants.
The UGC must be responsible for all students for a fair selection securing single opportunity for
each student. If you are in two minds whether to register or not, because you think that actually you
can perform better next time, our genuine advice is not to get registered.
23. What if a selected candidate has not satisfied at least 30% for the common general paper?
Candidates who have not obtained 30% or above for the Common General Paper are not eligible
for registration for the courses of study of the universities for which they have been selected based
on the Z Score in the current academic year.
If such a candidate has obtained a minimum of 30% for the Common General Paper in a previous
attempt within three attempts allowed for university admission, the previous achievement can be
considered.
Candidates who have not obtained a minimum of 30% shall re-sit & obtain a minimum of 30% for
the Common General Paper in a next available year within three attempts allowed for university
admission, to be eligible to get registered for the courses of study of the universities for which the
candidates have already been selected based on Z Score, in a future academic year.
24. How can students appeal for course changes?
Candidates can make appeals requesting to change their courses of study to lower preferences or
to apply for courses of study to which they have not indicated preferences in the original application.
All such applications are given serious consideration and we will attempt to fulfill student expectations
to the best of our ability, as long as it does not affect other students (conditions apply).
They should submit their appeals by sending specimen form given at the end of this Handbook,
along with evidence for payment within four weeks from releasing of cut-off points following
instructions in Section 4.4 of the Handbook.
- 244 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
25. Is it compulsory to get registered to a course of study of a university in order to send an
appeal?
No. You can send an appeal even without getting registered to the selected course of study of the
university, and also even if you have not selected to any of the courses of study.
26. What is “Promotion Declaration” ?
These two words appear only when you try to register online for the course of study of the university
you have already selected to.
Therefore, this is important only when you are completing the online registration form.
Simply, this means that when you fill the online registration form, you should select and then delete
(remove) all other Uni-Codes from the Uni-Codes list which you do not want us to consider you
when we fill the vacancies. This is because we always try to upgrade you to a higher Uni-Code
which you have requested.
 27.
How to declare promotions or how to complete the Promotion Declarations online?
You can declare your promotions online when getting registered to the selected course of study
of the university you prefer. The instructions are given below.
1.
Click on the Promotion Declaration button.
2.
Then, the list of higher preferred Uni-Codes than the currently selected course of study of
the university, arranged according to your order of preference will be displayed.
3.
Carefully select the Uni-Codes for which you do not want to be considered under
future rounds of filling of vacancies for which you have given higher preferences than the
already selected Uni-Code (put a “” mark in relevant check boxes). However, if you do
not want to be considered for any of the courses of study of universities (Uni-Codes) in
future for which you have given higher preferences and wish to remain in the already
selected course of study of university, you may click on the check box in the last column of
the header row to select all the Uni-Codes in one go. The Uni-Codes selected by you for
removal will be crossed off.
4.
Then, click on the REMOVE SELECTED HIGHER PREFERENCES button to remove
your unwanted Uni-Codes from the database. When you click on the REMOVE
SELECTED HIGHER PREFERENCES button, the window will not get closed, instead
your database will be updated. Next, click on the Back button to go back to the previous
page. (The Uni-Codes which you have selected as unwanted Uni-Codes for filling of
vacancies will also be displayed in the Online Payment Receipt generated at the end of the
online registration process).
(The Uni-Codes which you have selected as unwanted Uni-Codes for filling of vacancies
will be displayed in the Online Payment Receipt generated at the end of the online
registration process. This will help you to remember what you have marked as “Not to be
considered Uni-Codes”).
5.
If you want to re-change the Uni-Codes list which you have selected for removal, you can
re-follow the steps (1) to (4) above.
28.  What will happen if I do not remove the unwanted Uni-Codes to be considered under
 future rounds of filling of vacancies from the Uni-Codes list, when getting registered
 online for the currently selected course of study of the university?
If you fail to remove the courses of study of  universities (Uni-Codes) for which you do not want to
be considered in future rounds of filling of vacancies, we have no choice but to consider you for
promotions to those Uni-Codes.
- 245 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
It is important for you to realize that, if you have not requested to stay in the already selected
course of study of the university (Uni-Code) without getting elevated, we have no choice but to
promote you to your higher preferred Uni-Codes when filling the vacancies. Then you must  accept
and get registered for that course of study of the university you would get selected under filling
of vacancies.
Therefore, it is extremely important to inform this fact to us when getting registered online for the
course of study of the university you preferred.
29. Without removing all the Uni-codes, can I choose only few of the Uni-Codes as unwanted
Uni-Codes to be considered under future rounds of filling of vacancies, to which I have
given higher preferences than the already selected course of study of  the university
(Uni-Code)?
Yes.
First you should put  “

” marks in the check boxes of the unwanted Uni-Codes.
Then, you should remove the unwanted Uni-Codes from the list of Uni-Codes by clicking on the
REMOVE SELECTED HIGHER PREFERENCES button.
30. Will my appeal be considered for a course of study of a university (Uni-Code) for which I
have fulfilled the Z-Score, yet not requested in the application form.
Only the appeals which will be sent within 4 weeks of releasing minimum Z score marks for
university admissions will be considered. However, the chance to get selected to the requested Uni-
Code is very rare since your request can be accommodated only if there are vacancies in the
relevant course of study of the university. This is because we have already given this chance to the
other students who have requested that Uni-Code.
Therefore, it is important to fill as much Uni-Codes as possible in your application form
for university admission.
31. I got selected for the course of study in Biological Science at University of Peradeniya
under the normal intake which is my 5th preference in the application form. However, as I
am much more interested in the course of study in Biological Science at University of Sri
Jayewardenepura or Biological Science at University of Colombo which are my 4th and 3rd
preferences in the application form respectively, I decided not to get registered for the
course of study in Biological Science at University of Peradeniya. Therefore, will there be
any possibility of getting me selected for the course of study in Biological Science at
University of Sri Jayewardenepura or University of Colombo under filling of vacancies?
There is no possibility.
If you do not get registered for a course of study of a university selected, you will not then be
considered for any of the universities to follow that course of study to which you have given higher
preferences than the course of study of the university already selected.  Instead, your application
will be considered for the next preferred course of study.
Therefore, if you are looking forward to get selected for a different university to follow the same
course of study under the filling of vacancies, to which you have given higher preference than the
already selected university, first you must get registered at UGC for that course of study of the
university already selected.
Otherwise, your application will not be considered in future for other universities to follow that
course of study, to which you have given higher preferences.
- 246 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
32. I got registered for the selected course of study in Biological Science at University of
Peradeniya under the normal intake which is my 5th preference in the application form, as
advised above. Afterwards, I got selected to follow the course of study in Biological Science
at University of Sri Jayewardenepura which is my 4th preference, under filling of vacancies.
However, since I prefer to get selected for Biological Science at University of Colombo
which is my higher preference than this (3rd preference), I decided not to get registered
for  Biological Science at University of Sri Jayewardenepura to which I got selected under
filling of vacancies. Therefore, will there be any possibility of getting me selected for the
course of study in Biological Science at University of Colombo under future rounds of
filling of vacancies?
There is no possibility.
Even though you already got registered for the course of study in Biological Science at University
of Peradeniya, if you do not get registered for the course of study in Biological Science at University
of Sri Jayewardenepura which is your 4th preference to which you got selected under filling of
vacancies, your application will no longer be considered for the course of study in Biological Science
at University of Colombo to which you are willing to get selected in a future round of filling of
vacancies which is your 3rd preference in the application form.
Therefore, if you want to consider your application for the course of study in Biological Science at
University of Colombo under a future round of filling of vacancies, first you should get registered
for the course of study in Biological Science at University of Sri Jayewardenepura to which you got
selected under filling of vacancies. Otherwise, your application will no longer be considered for the
course of study in Biological Science.
33. Is there any difference between the Special Degrees and Honours Degrees?
There is no any difference.
Based on the instructions of the Sri Lanka Qualifications Framework (SLQF) on naming the degree
programmes, the newly introduced degree programmes have been named as Honours degrees
instead of Special degrees. Therefore, that does not affect the contents and the quality of the
degree  programme.
34. Will I be considered under filling of vacancies in future, if I do not get registered to the
currently selected course of study of the university?
As mentioned in the sub section “Important” of Section 3.2, if you do not get registered  for the
currently selected course of study of the university, you would not be considered for any other
university to follow the same course of study under future rounds of filling of vacancies, for which
you have indicated higher preferences. However, your application will be considered for other
courses of study under future rounds of filling of vacancies, for which you have indicated higher
preferences than the currently selected course of study for which you did not get registered.
35. Whether two groups of students have sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examination
2020?
Yes
The students who sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examination 2020, from the new syllabus
and the students who sat for the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examination 2020, from the old syllabus
are the two groups.
- 247 -
UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/2021
     36. How the number of students to be selected for a course of study from the old syllabus
and  the new syllabus are determined?
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) decided to consider the students who sat for the G.C.E.
(A/L) Examination held in the year 2020 under new syllabus and old syllabus as two distinct
populations as directed by the Supreme Court in SC (FR) Application No. 29/2012.
a.   The percentage of students to be admitted to universities from those sat for the G.C.E. (A/L)
Examination under the new syllabus in the year 2020 for each degree programme (course of
study) on district merit from each district and all island merit shall be the composite average
percentage of students admitted to universities through their first and second attempts during
the five year period from 2014 to 2018 for that particular degree programme (course of study)
on district merit from each district and all island merit, respectively.
  b.  The percentage of students to be admitted to universities from those sat for the G.C.E. (A/L)
Examination under the old syllabus in the year 2020 for each degree programme (course of
study) on district merit from each district and all island merit shall be the composite average
percentage of students admitted to universities through their third attempt during the five year
period from 2014 to 2018 for that particular degree programme (course of study) on district
merit from each district and all island merit, respectively.
However, due to non availability of complete 5 years data of the courses of study introduced after
academic year 2014/2015 in order to select students based on the criteria mentioned under ‘a’ and
‘b’ above, selection of students for those courses of study will be done based only on the available
data of the said courses of study.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.

* Selection 100% on an all Island Merit Basis         # Courses of Study for which the subject oriented Practical / Aptitude Tests were conducted. 
NQC - No Qualified Candidates. This may be due to the following reasons.
1.  District quota for a given course of study in a given district has already been filled by the students of that district.
2.  Number of places in a given course of study in a given university has already been filled by the students with higher Z-scores from other districts.
3.  No candidates who have satisfied the minimum requirements for admission for a given course of study from that district.
Note :
Certain courses of study are not conducted in all three languages. Therefore some students may not get selected to such courses of study in some universities, even though they have obtained the minimum Z-score required to get selected.
